# Xact-React System Report

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a reconstruction and upgrade of the  Xact system, using the **React** **frontend** framework to replace the original MFC/Qt interface while retaining the original **C++ backend** functional modules. The project aims to provide a **modern user interface and interaction experience** while maintaining full compatibility with the original X-ray control, CNC control, detector control, and image processing functions.

## 4. Comparison Between Old and New Systems

### 4.1 User Interface Comparison

| Feature                      | Old System                                    | New System                                                   | Advantage                                            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Overall Layout               | Fixed layout, non-adjustable functional areas | Responsive layout, supporting collapse/expand and floating windows | Improved space utilization, enhanced user experience |
| Control Panel                | Fixed position, non-movable                   | Draggable floating window, position adjustable               | Higher flexibility, adapts to different workflows    |
| Visual Style                 | Traditional Windows style, gray tone          | Modern design, clear color coding and icons                  | More intuitive and aesthetic, lower learning curve   |
| Functional Area Organization | Deep hierarchy, requires multiple clicks      | Flat design, quick access with collapsible panels            | Improved operation efficiency, reduced click count   |
| Image Processing             | Fixed toolbar, occupies interface space       | Floating toolbar, displayed as needed                        | Focus on image observation, reduced distraction      |

### 4.2 Technical Architecture Comparison

| Feature                        | Old System             | New System                              | Advantage                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend Framework             | MFC/Qt (C++)           | React (JavaScript)                      | Higher development efficiency, component reuse, rich ecosystem |
| Rendering Engine               | GDI/DirectX            | WebGL (PixiJS)                          | High-performance image rendering, GPU acceleration           |
| UI Components                  | Custom controls        | React components + Tailwind CSS         | Rapid development, consistent visual style                   |
| Frontend-Backend Communication | Tightly coupled C++    | WebView2 bridging                       | Decoupled frontend and backend, independent development and testing |
| Code Organization              | Weak modularity        | Fully componentized                     | Better maintainability and scalability                       |
| State Management               | Distributed management | Centralized management with React Hooks | Predictable state changes, easier debugging                  |

### 4.3 Performance Comparison

| Feature          | Old System    | New System                     | Advantage                          |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Startup Time     | Faster        | Slightly slower but acceptable | Higher feature integration         |
| Image Rendering  | Good          | Excellent (WebGL acceleration) | Smoother large image processing    |
| Memory Usage     | Lower         | Slightly higher but stable     | Richer features, better experience |
| Response Speed   | Good          | Good                           | Maintained system responsiveness   |
